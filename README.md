C pattern programs involve using loops (primarily nested loops) and conditional statements to print various shapes, designs, or sequences of characters (like stars, numbers, or alphabets) to the console. These programs are fundamental for beginners in C programming as they help in understanding and practicing:

Nested Loops:
How to use one loop inside another to control rows and columns for pattern formation.
Conditional Statements:
Using if-else to determine what to print at specific positions within the pattern.
Logical Thinking:
Developing the ability to break down a complex pattern into simpler steps and translate them into code.
